# ExpressionChecker_Hackathon
This is a Semantic Expression Checker.
This program can handle thousands of expressions given at a time.
Each and every expression can be as complex as possible provided it has only four basic math operations(+,-,*,/)  and every expression is well balanced and syntactically correct.
The most salient feature of this program is that it generates a text file as an output containing results for all the expressions.
